## Análisis de terminologías de salud para su utilización como ontologías computacionales en los sistemas de información clínicos {#análisis-de-terminologías-de-salud-para-su-utilización-como-ontologías-computacionales-en-los-sistemas-de-información-clínicos}

The authors of this work discuss the necessity of using an ontology to classify
clinical information, transforming it into a format that is both operational and
machine-readable.

Currently, sharing clinical information between centers in different autonomous
regions or countries is a complex challenge. The Historical Electronic
Conversion (HCE) process is managed by multiple subsystems, each responsible for
highly specific tasks. These subsystems collectively form a distributed,
interconnected system. However, each subsystem retains its own terminology and
operates as an independent unit of data.

The authors highlight a critical issue: the inconsistent use of terminology. The
same terms are often used to represent different concepts, while different terms
may be used to describe the same concept. To address this, the information
system must understand the meanings of terms, not just their normative
input/output relationships.

The primary objective of this study is to provide a qualitative analysis of the
most commonly used terminologies in the healthcare field.

For their analysis, the authors applied the following inclusion criteria:

-   Relevance
-   Presence in any of the official languages of the European Union (EU)

The metrics used for evaluation were:

1.  Conceptual Coverage
    -   Purpose: The intended use of the terminology.
    -   Utility Range: The breadth of scenarios in which the terminology is applicable.
    -   Hierarchy Type:
        -   Monoaxial: Categories and subcategories are organized in a logical order, grouping specific (child) concepts under broader (parent) concepts.
        -   Multiaxial: The domain features multiple hierarchies, allowing a concept (child) to belong to more than one category (parent).
        -   Compositionality: The ability to construct complex concepts using simpler building blocks (primitives).
        -   Lexical-Conceptual Organization: The structuring of terms based on their meanings.
2.  Granularity of Categories:
    -   The level of detail provided by the categories.
3.  Conceptual Relationships
    -   The relationships between concepts, often based on hierarchy or semantics.
4.  Formality of Representation
    -   This metric evaluates the position of the representation on the continuum between natural human languages and formal computer languages.
