## Parra-calderon2024 ICDS {#parra-calderon2024-icds}

The paper introduces a framework for digitization of Clinical Practice
Guidelines. The Authors explain that, although this process could be considered a mechanism
for improving patient treatment and the health professional performance, some
researchers have found barriers to adopting these kind of systems.

Lugtenberg et al., through a qualitative study involving more than 30
professionals, identified the following limitations:

1.  Lack of applicability
2.  Lack of evidence
3.  Lack of flexibility due to organizational restrictions
4.  Lack of clinical knowledge about the recommendations offered by each CPG
5.  Ambiguity in how those recommendations are described.

Also, Cabana et al. identified similar barriers:

1.  Lack of awareness about the existence of guidelines
2.  Lack of consensus
3.  Perceived interference with the criteria of the healthcare professional
4.  Lack of understanding of clinical rules and recommendations
5.  Inherent difficulty of getting health professionals to change their habits.

Both studies highlight that there is an entry barrier in clinical environments
due to the lack of consensus, the need to change the work flow and the steep
learning curve of the tools. Also, these tools are perceived as interference between
doctors and patient by the health professionals. The lack of consensus is
emphasized, as many of these systems are developed _ad hoc_ for clinical
institutions. Each institution has its own medical committees that decide
how clinical guidelines should be used by their healthcare professionals.

Some characteristics that the framework's authors consider relevant are:

1.  Centralization -&gt; A kernel capable of manage all the systems.
2.  Integration -&gt; A single platform providing all the resources needed for
    defining, executing and monitoring the CPGs.
3.  Collaboration -&gt; Sharing information between different facilities.
4.  Evolution -&gt; Ensuring the framework evolves as the CPG changes

While examining the state of the art of different tools similar to the framework
they propose, they have found:

1.  The work of Mathe et al. presents a model-based approach for developing CDSS.
    This approach demonstrates the utility of domain models for representing
    clinical information.
2.  Rahmani et al present a method for translating medical knowledge into
    verifiable finite state machine models, ensuring their correctness before
    code generation.
3.  PROforma is a language in the logic programming and object-oriented modeling
    which is expressive enough to model guidelines.
4.  KnowWe is semantic wiki integrated into d3web. This wiki uses DIAFlux, a
    graphical modeling languages. This language allow guidelines to be visualized
    as flowcharts

The article's conclusion suggests that:

1.  it is possible to produce a reduction of the variability in the healthcare
    practice as the workflow is guided and suggested by the clinical
    recommendations.
2.  It includes the possibility of providing feedback to improve the platform by
    recording the reason why a recommendation was not followed.
3.  Patients follow-up time could be reduced.
4.  It helps to improve the personalized attention of each patient; the patient
    care and patient safety.

These four points give an extra advantage as the health care costs are reduced.
