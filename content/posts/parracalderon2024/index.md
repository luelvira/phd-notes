## IDE4 ICDS: A Human-Centric and Model-Driven Proposal to Improve the Digitization of Clinical Practice Guideline {#ide4-icds-a-human-centric-and-model-driven-proposal-to-improve-the-digitization-of-clinical-practice-guideline}

The work of this paper introduces a framework aimed at enhancing the management
and digitization of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). Although clinical
guidelines can be considered as mechanisms for improving patient treatment,
improving the performance of health professionals, some researchers have
identified factors which be an obstacle for their adoption:

1.  Lugtenberg et al describe the following problems:
    1.  Lack of applicability
    2.  Lack of evidence
    3.  Lack of flexibility due to organizational restrictions
    4.  Lack of clinical knowledge about the recommendations offered by each CPG
    5.  Ambiguity in how  those recommendations are described.
2.  Cabana et al. also identifies similar barriers:
    1.  Lack of awareness about the existence of guidelines
    2.  Lack of consensus
    3.  Perceived interference with the criteria of the healthcare professional
    4.  Lack of understanding of clinical rules and recommendations
    5.  Inherent difficulty of getting health professionals to change their habits.

The paper highlight that, although these systems may be correctly defined, the
frequency of CPG evolution means that solutions must be provided regarding other
essential aspects related to CPG maintenance and traceability.

The requirements of the projects authors are presenting on this paper are:

1.  Centralization: A single nucleus of information is stored and traceability is
    maintained between all the components.
2.  Integration: A single platform provides modules for defining, executing and
    monitoring CPGs
3.  Collaboration.

The conclusion of the research suggests that:

1.  It is possible to produce a reduction of the variability in the healthcare
    practice as the workflow is guided and suggests by the clinical
    recommendations.
2.  It Include the possibility of providing feedback to improve the platform by
    recording the reason why a recommendation was not followed.
3.  Patients follow-up time could be reduced
4.  It helps to Improve the personalized attention of each patient; the patient
    care and patient safety

As consequence of these points, reduce health care costs.
