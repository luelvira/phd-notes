* Isabelle/jEdit as IDE for Domain-specific Formal Languages and Informal Text Documents

Makarius Wenzel explores the use of Isabelle/JEdit as a IDE for both formal
languages and informal text documents.

First of all, Isabelle is an interactive theorem proving system, and JEdit is a
text editor written in Java. Isabelle/JEdit combines both as a front-end for the
Prover IDE (PIDE). This editor aims to support users in reading and writing
proof documents with continuous background checking by the prover.
